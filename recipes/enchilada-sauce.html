        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Southern-style red enchilada sauce. By contrast to many Mexican-style enchilada sauces, this recipe does not include tomatoes but rather centers its flavor around a rich blend of seasonings that you likely already have in your pantry (chili powder, cumin, garlic and oregano). On its own, the sauce is naturally fairly mild, although you are welcome to amp up the heat if youâ€™d like. And its deliciously warm, toasty, earthy flavors pair perfectly with any variety of enchilada recipes.</p>

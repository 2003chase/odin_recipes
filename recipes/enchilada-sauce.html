        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Southern-style red enchilada sauce. By contrast to many Mexican-style enchilada sauces, this recipe does not include tomatoes but rather centers its flavor around a rich blend of seasonings that you likely already have in your pantry (chili powder, cumin, garlic and oregano). On its own, the sauce is naturally fairly mild, although you are welcome to amp up the heat if youâ€™d like. And its deliciously warm, toasty, earthy flavors pair perfectly with any variety of enchilada recipes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil or olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chili powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>Fine sea salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook the roux and spices.</strong> Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add flour and cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly.  Add in the chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and oregano and cook for 1 more minute, whisking constantly.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer.</strong> Gradually pour in the stock, whisking constantly to combine until no lumps remain.  Continue cooking until the sauce reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low to maintain the simmer (the sauce should continue lightly bubbling) for about 10-15 minutes, uncovered, until the sauce has slightly thickened.</li>
            <li><strong>Season.</strong> Give the sauce a taste and season with salt, as needed.  (I typically add 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt, but the saltiness of the sauce can vary depending on the brand of stock that you use.)</li>
            <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Use immediately in your favorite recipe and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

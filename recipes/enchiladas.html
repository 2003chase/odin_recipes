        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>For those of you who are new to this recipe, these Tex-Mex style chicken enchiladas are easy to make with a basic filling of sautéed chicken, green chiles, onions, beans and shredded cheese. Then they are rolled up in your choice of either flour or corn tortillas, baked until hot and melty, and sprinkled with lots of fresh toppings. But I have to say that the real magic of this recipe lies in the homemade red enchilada sauce that brings it all together. This red enchilada sauce only requires a few extra minutes of prep time, but the flavor that it adds to these enchiladas is major. Sooo much better than the canned stuff!</p>
    
        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 tablespoons avocado oil (or olive oil)</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into small 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 (4-ounce) can diced green chiles</li>
            <li>Sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (15-ounce) can black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>8 large flour tortillas</li>
            <li>3 cups Mexican-blend shredded cheese</li>
            <li>1 batch <a href="./enchilada-sauce.html">red enchilada sauce</a></li>
            <li>Optional toppings: fresh cilantro, chopped red onions, diced avocado, sour cream, and/or crumbled cotija cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prep oven and enchilada sauce.</strong> Preheat oven to 350°F.  Prepare your enchilada sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Sauté the filling mixture.</strong> In large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add diced chicken and green chiles, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.  Sauté the mixture for 6-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the chicken is cooked through.  Add in the beans and stir until evenly combined.  Remove pan from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li><strong>Assemble the enchiladas.</strong> To assemble the enchiladas, set up an assembly line including: tortillas, enchilada sauce, chicken mixture, and cheese. Lay out a tortilla, and spread two tablespoons of sauce over the surface of the tortilla.  Add a generous spoonful of the chicken mixture in a line down the center of the tortilla, then sprinkle with 1/3 cup cheese. Roll up tortilla and place in a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish. Assemble the remaining enchiladas.  Then spread any remaining sauce evenly over the top of the enchiladas, followed by any extra cheese.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake.</strong> Bake uncovered for 20 minutes, until the enchiladas are cooked through and the tortillas are slightly crispy on the outside.  Transfer the baking dish to a wire baking rack.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve.</strong> Serve the enchiladas immediately while they’re nice and hot and melty, garnished with lots of fresh toppings. Enjoy!</li>
